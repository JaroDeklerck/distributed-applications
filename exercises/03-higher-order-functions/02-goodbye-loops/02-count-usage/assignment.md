# Assignment

## Task

Write a function `Grades.passed_percentage(grades)` that, given
a list of grades (integers between `0` and `20`) computes
the percentage of passing grade.

* A grade is considered passing if it is at least `10`.
* The result should be a value between `0` and `100`.
* The result should be rounded to the nearest integer value. You'll have to [look up how](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=elixir+round+float+to+integer).
